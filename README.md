# Flood-Monitoring-System
Flood is a major known natural disaster that causes a huge amount of loss to the environment and living beings. Floods impact on both individuals and communities, and have social, economic, and environmental consequences. The consequences of floods, both negative and positive, vary greatly depending on the location and extent of flooding, and the vulnerability and value of the natural and constructed environments they affect. So in these conditions, it is most crucial to get the emergency alerts of water level  status at river beds in different conditions.Our project will provide real-time analysis of floods and help the locality to take necessary preventive measures
